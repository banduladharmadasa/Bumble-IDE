This is a fully functional code editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed in 2020. It was created using Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and JavaScript as a hobby project to understand the workflow of a fully functional integrated environment. I completed most of the key parts of the IDE; however, the debugger is missing, and I have only partially completed the plugin architecture.

## Key Features:

- Supports more than 110 programming languages.
- Auto completion, code snippets.
- Emmet support for web development.
- Utilizes a multiple document architecture.
- Provides a drag-and-drop capable multiview mode.
- Incorporates a smart file management system, enabling quick access to files through comma-separated multiple wild card filtering. It also continuously monitors changes made by external editors.
- Includes an inline editing mode, allowing users to access code from anywhere without losing the current view.
- Offers a selection of more than 20 themes.
- Supports code folding.
- Includes multiple cursors and selections.
- Features an embedded server for running web applications.
- Allows compilation and running of code while editing.
- Offers a color palette for selecting known HTML colors in HTML, RGB, HSL, HSV, and CMYK formats.

## Development Status

I am not actively involved in further development, this application is fully functional, and the source code is open for exploration and improvement. Feel free to use it to enhance the existing features, learn how to develop a similar app, or reuse components for your own projects..
Happy coding!
